# JobFinder (Java-based App): Simplified Demo

The Project 'JobFindSystem' is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the job search and hiring process. It offers a console platform for job seekers to register, express interest in job listings, and receive tailored job recommendations based on their preferences and qualifications. Employers can post job opportunities, manage applications, and deactivate listings as needed. This is a demo version, developed with a focus on SOLID Principles and Design Patterns. 

## Documentation
The repository provides a 'Documentation' folder enriched with a detailed PDF guide and illustrative diagrams, specifically an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Class Diagram. These visual aids underscore the application's database schema and object-oriented architecture, offering a deep dive into the user requirements, system's design and operational flow. 

**PLEASE NOTE that the main requirement of the Project was to visualize the system's model rather than its complete software development.**

## How to run
To experience the console application firsthand, users can run the _.jar_ file located in the project's folder _out/artifacts/JobFindSystem_jar/JobFindSystem.jar_.
